# EPiServer.Forms MVC Views

This is a collection of all EPiServer.Forms views in Razor syntax. These are normally delivered as WebForms ascx in the EPiServer.Forms NuGet package.

This was inspired by *Custom Forms Element view with Razor code* [here](https://support.episerver.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002855631-Custom-Forms-Element-view-with-Razor-code) and semi solved using *WebForms Views to Razor* [here](https://github.com/telerik/razor-converter).

âš  The current output has NOT been tested thoroughly!

It is based on EPiServer.Forms 4.27.0.
